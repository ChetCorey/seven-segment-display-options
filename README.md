Run in with Ruby +1.8.7 `ruby longest_english_word.rb`
Than paste a path to your words file.

It can handle a list of words in a string, or an array of words in JSON.

The results that I came up with from this list is.
from the words_alpha.txt file I got

| word | file |
| ---- | ---- |
|dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|words_alpha.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/word-list/master/words.txt|
|intersubstitutabilities|words.json|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/words/an-array-of-english-words/master/words.json|
